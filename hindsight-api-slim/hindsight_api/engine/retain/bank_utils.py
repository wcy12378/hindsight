    A store-owned bank writes no ``memory_units`` rows at all, so its three partial
    indexes can only ever be empty — and an empty index is not free. Postgres plans
    against every index on a relation, so 3 x banks empty indexes on the shared
    ``memory_units`` tax every OTHER statement that so much as names the table: a
    tenant with 27,315 store-owned banks carried 82,795 of them and paid ~975 ms of
    planning for a query over zero rows (#4615). #4326 took the same decision for the
    whole-table reconcile — dimension resize, global vector and text indexes — but it
    does not reach the per-bank loops, which are built from the engine, not migrations.

    Asked per bank, not per deployment: a router can keep some banks in SQL and some
    in a store (:meth:`MemoriesExtension.store_owned_for`), and getting this backwards
    is silent — an SQL-owned bank without its index still recalls, just without ANN.
    A store that cannot answer is treated as SQL-backed, which is the safe direction:
    the bank keeps the index it would have had before this existed. Logged rather than
    swallowed, because that fallback re-arms #4615 — a router that throws goes back to
    three empty indexes per bank, and at 27k banks nothing else would say so.

    Only does anything when the size threshold is off — the default — where a
    bank is entitled to its indexes from the moment it exists and building them
    here is instant, because the bank is empty. That is the behaviour that
    predates the threshold, and keeping it means the default deployment never
    submits a ``vector_index_maintenance`` operation and never pays a coverage
    check on a write.

    With ``HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_INDEX_MIN_ROWS`` set, a fresh bank has not earned
    anything yet, so this is a no-op and the maintenance operation builds an
    index CONCURRENTLY if and when the bank grows into one — which also keeps
    CREATE INDEX's ShareLock on the shared memory_units table off the write path.

    Respects the HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_EXTENSION config to use the appropriate
    index type (HNSW for pgvector, DiskANN for pgvectorscale, vchordrq for vchord).

    AlloyDB ScaNN uses global vector indexes with filtered vector search; it
    cannot safely create per-bank indexes at bank-creation time because new
    banks have no embedding rows. On Oracle 23ai this is likewise a no-op —
    Oracle uses a single global vector index created during migrations, and does
    not support partial (WHERE-clause) vector indexes.

    A bank whose memories a custom store owns is the third no-op, and the only one
    decided per bank rather than per deployment: it has no memory_units rows to index
    (see :func:`bank_indexes_are_store_owned`).

    bank_id is escaped for SQL literal safety (apostrophes doubled).

    ``ops`` is required rather than defaulting to None: it is only dereferenced
    in the eager branch, so a caller that forgot it used to work fine until the
    threshold happened to be off, and then failed on an AttributeError from
    inside bank creation.

    the bank — a document re-retained/appended to, or a fact stored. Appending
    to a long-lived document does not move ``last_document_at``, which is why

    aggregating all of ``memory_units`` to render one page of banks, which is what made a

    """One page of banks, most recently written first, WITHOUT ranking every bank to find it.

    :func:`list_banks` reads the whole tenant because the order depends on a value only the store
    has: it asks for every bank's write time, sorts, and throws away all but a page. That is
    O(total banks) per request — 60-75 s on a tenant with 27,315 banks, and the endpoint's entire
    cost. The work is not the sorting, it is fetching N sort keys to produce 100 rows.

    A store that can hand back its banks ALREADY ordered removes the need to. The page is then a
    merge of two streams that are each already sorted:

      * the store's banks, newest-written first, cursor-paged;
      * this tenant's banks by ``created_at``, newest first, off a SQL index.

    A bank the store has never recorded (never written, or written but not yet folded) comes from
    the second stream and keeps the same fallback key :func:`list_banks` gives it — its creation
    time — so the two agree about where such a bank belongs. Merging two sorted streams costs the
    page, not the tenant.

    That agreement assumes a tenant's memories all live in one place: whichever store answers here
    owns every bank in it. A tenant with BOTH store-owned and Postgres-owned banks would break it,
    because a Postgres-owned bank is absent from the store stream and would then be placed by its
    creation time while :func:`list_banks` places it by its newest document or fact write. No
    deployment mixes the two; a deployment that starts to must key the creation stream off those
    same two columns rather than off `created_at`.

    Falls back to :func:`list_banks` whenever the merge cannot be trusted to page correctly:

      * a store that returns no ordering of its own. Then the write times are SQL columns, the
        ordering is already one indexed query, and there is nothing a store stream could add — a
        merge against an empty stream would silently reorder such a tenant by CREATION time;
      * a search, which matches on ``bank_id`` and ``name``. Those live only in SQL, so the store
        cannot apply it and its stream would be the wrong set. A search narrows to few rows anyway,
        which is where ranking them all is cheap.

    The first of those is decided by ASKING the store for a page, not by reading a capability flag
    off it. ``store_owned`` is the wrong question and answers it wrongly: a router whose banks live
    in different backends declares ``store_owned = False`` at the class level and answers per bank
    through ``store_owned_for``, so a flag check sends an entirely store-owned tenant down the
    ranking path — correct output, and the whole cost this exists to remove. What the merge actually
    needs to know is whether there is an ordering to merge, and the page it is about to consume is
    the answer.

    ``total`` counts the banks matching the search, before paging.

    Those banks leave the ``memory_units`` join empty, so the count has to come from the store.
    Still page-scoped rather than system-wide, but ONE batched call for that page instead of a
    round trip per bank: asking per bank made the page cost a network hop each, and on dev a
    108-bank page took ~8s end-to-end, almost all of it those hops — most against banks with
    nothing in them. :meth:`count_memories_many` is the same question asked once.

    ``strong=True``, deliberately. The per-bank call this replaces reads the un-folded tail, so
    anything weaker would fold a change in what a just-written bank REPORTS into what was meant to
    be a change in how long it takes. The batched read applies the tail without opening a snapshot,
    so a page of N banks still cannot admit N banks and evict whatever was warm.

    A bank the store has no count for reports zero, per the interface's contract that absent means
    nothing to count — so one bank cannot fail the page.

    No connection is held across this: it is a network call to another service and nothing here
    needs one. Holding a pooled connection across the per-bank loop was the other half of the cost
